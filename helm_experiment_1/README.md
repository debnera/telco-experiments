OAI + helm experiment

- A full MANO stack is too complicated
- Starting with a simpler kubernetes + Kepler setup seems more reasonable
- OAI has some helm charts
  - Also mentions about helm charts being moved to a separate "Orchestration" repository
  - But these new folders are mostly empty, but some contain non-empty git branches
